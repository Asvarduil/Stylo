# Environment

Stylo is developed using TypeScript. It's highly recommended to use VS Code and to install the TypeScript support extensions. Other IDEs can probably be used without any issues, I just haven't used them...yet.  

Be sure to run `npm install` to pull all relevant dependencies.  

# To Run the Prototype Code

Use the following command to run the developmental tests:

`npx ts-node src/test/tests.ts`
