# What is Stylo?
**Stylo** is to CSS and SCSS, as TypeScript is a successor to JavaScript.  

Many developers find the syntax in CSS and SCSS overwhelming and unreadable. This deficiency is what Stylo is built to overcome, by way of a simplified Python-like syntax that encourages good style coding habits.

Stylo offers the following language features:
1. Easy, clean language syntax where whitespace matters
2. First-class support for custom tokens and theming
3. Just enough backwards compatibility with CSS to be helpful
4. Mixins that can let you automate frequent patterns

## Environment

Stylo is developed using TypeScript. It's highly recommended to use VS Code and to install the TypeScript support extensions. Other IDEs can probably be used without any issues, I just haven't used them...yet.  

Be sure to run `npm install` to pull all relevant dependencies.  

## To Run the Prototype Code

Use the following command to run the developmental tests:

`npm test`
